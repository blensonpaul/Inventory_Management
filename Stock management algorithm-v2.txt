"Stock-In-Hand"
"New-Order"
"Out-stock"
"Not-Available"
ignore and keep the other sheets as it is 


"Stock-In-Hand" sheet labels:

"Sl No", "Part Number", "Part Description", "Qty", "Unit Weight(gm)","HS Code", "Origin", "Location", "KME Case Ref", "Ref", "BO lookup", "SO Number", "SRV Remarks", "Date (added) yyy.mm.dd", "REFERENCE", "D/NO", "srv print"

"New-Order" sheet labels:
"Sl No", "Part Number", "Part Description", "Req-Qty", "REFERENCE", "D/NO", "Date", "Mail Reference"

"Out-stock" sheet labels:
"Sl No", "Part Number", "Part Description", "Qty", "Unit Weight(gm)","HS Code", "Origin", "Location", "KME Case Ref", "Ref", "BO lookup", "SO Number", "SRV Remarks", "Date (added) yyy.mm.dd", "REFERENCE", "D/NO", "Batch/ Case", "Date", "Mail Reference", "srv print"

"Not-Available" sheet labels:
"Sl No", "Part Number", "Part Description", "Req-Qty", "REFERENCE", "D/NO", "Date", "Mail Reference", "NA-Qty"


"Stock-In-Hand" sheet represents stock in hand, Newly arrived stock added here manually.
-same Part Number can arrive on different dates
-same Part Number can arrive on same date with multiple lines 
-same Part number can have different HS Code & Origin 

"New-Order" sheet will contain new packing orders which we are going to be picked from the stock 

---------------

Write a python (google collab) full code to accept the excel file with above sheets 
create a picking list as per the New-Order sheet and
Record the picking list in the Out-stock sheet 

---------------
detailed picking list generation/recording  algorithm
take the "New-Order" sheet "Part Number", "Req-Qty" and do a for loop in the "Stock-In-Hand" sheet 

when the part number is matching there are these cases
1) when the "Stock-In-Hand" quantity matching exactly then record it in the "Out-stock" sheet and delete the line from the "Stock-In-Hand" sheet (If there is error for deleting line then you can subtract the quantity from the "Stock-In-Hand" sheet)
2) when the "Stock-In-Hand" quantity is greater then "New-Order" quantity then record it in the "Out-stock" sheet and subtract the quantity from the "Stock-In-Hand" sheet
3) when the "Stock-In-Hand" quantity is less then "New-Order" quantity (but not zero) then record it in the "Out-stock" sheet and subtract the quantity from the "Stock-In-Hand" sheet and repeat the loop. keep track of "total picked quantity" for calculating not available quantity later
(This is because for example "Stock-In-Hand" sheet may contain 10 quantities in 10 lines with 1 quantity in each line)
4) If still(after going through all lines of the same part number) "New-Order" quantities are not picked then record the not available quantity "NA-Qty" in the "Not-Available" sheet by subtracting Total Picked quantity from "Req-Qty".
 
while recording Picking list in "Out-stock" sheet Give the values of "REFERENCE", "D/NO", "Date", "Mail Reference" as per New-Order sheet.
-Keep the "Batch/ Case" empty which will be filled manually after packing.

at the end
-clear the New-Order sheet data 

download the updated Master-stock along with the other unused sheets with timestamp as the filename
